## ChipWizardâ„¢ Professional Leaderboard

Here are collected all the top scores to the official levels.

The leaderboard collects solution files of all the known top solutions.
For every primary metric (TODO, FIXME) both the other metrics are considered as tiebreakers,
so a level may have at most 2 lines in the table.

Solutions are either attributed to the original author, or attributed to `Community` if many people obtained it
independently early in the game release period or many people collaborated on it.

The ðŸ“„ icons are links to the solution files, which can be opened in-game.

#### Submitting a New Solution

To submit a solution you need to get the corresponding solution string in the save folder.

In the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/98QNzdJ), invoke the Leaderboard Bot via `/cw submit solution:<export link> author:<your name>`.
Use `m1` for the solution link to refer to the preceding message if that's how you uploaded the export.

You can use the optional `image` parameter to give a screenshot of

#### Solution files repository

The Leaderboard Bot will cause each submitted solution export to be automatically rehosted
in the [leaderboard git repository](https://github.com/lastcallbbs-community-developers/chipwizard-leaderboard),
where are stored solution files for the whole [pareto frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) of each level.

You can add frontier scores to the archive by going to the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/98QNzdJ)
and invoking the Leaderboard Bot via `/cw submit solution:<export link> author:<your name>` exactly as you would with a record submission.

If you want to import a previously stored solution, you can find it by following the relevant link in this table (if it is a record solution);
or by going to the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/98QNzdJ) and invoking the Leaderboard Bot via `/cw frontier puzzle: <puzzle name>`.  
The files can be copied directly into the game's save folder and opened in-game.
